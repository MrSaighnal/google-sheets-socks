# GSSocks - Google Sheets SOCKS

**Google Sheets SOCKS (GSS)** is a post exploitation tool that implements Socks5 proxy channel using **Google Sheets** as the middle-man.  
It enables **SOCKS5-like proxying over spreadsheets**, making it a powerful alternative when it‚Äôs too risky or impractical to deploy a classic C2 infrastructure.

> ‚úÖ No need for VPS, DNS tunneling, or custom domains; just Google Sheets and a service account.

## üß† Concept

GSSocks creates a covert communication channel between a **client** (running on the attaccker system) and a **server** (deployed on target system).  
All traffic is tunneled through Google Sheets in base64-encoded chunks, simulating SOCKS5 behavior internally.

- The client writes data to the sheet using a connection ID and a role tag (`client`).
- The server reads and processes this data, opens the target connection, and sends the response back via the same sheet (`server` role).
- This allows arbitrary TCP connections from inside hardened environments with only Google services whitelisted.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Client** opens a local TCP listener (default: `:9191`) and encodes all data in base64.
2. **Each chunk** is written to Google Sheets using a unique `connID`.
3. **Server** polls Google Sheets:
   - Waits for SOCKS5 handshake data
   - Parses the target address from the payload
   - Connects to the real destination
4. **Server response** is encoded, uploaded, and later read by the client.
5. Communication continues asynchronously, chunk by chunk.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Create a Google Sheet and share it with the Service Account email.
2. Place the Google Sheet ID inside the client and server files
3. Place the service account JSON inside the `rawCredentials` array.
4. Build the tools:

```bash
go build -o client ./client.go
go build -o server ./server.go
go build -o goproxy ./goproxy.go
```
5. Deploy the server and the goproxy binaries on the target machine and run it
6. Run the client on the attacker machine
7. configure proxychains to connect by using Socks5 protocol on port 9191
8. Use your favourite tool via proxychains
